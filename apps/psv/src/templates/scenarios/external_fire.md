## External Fire Relief Scenario Analysis

### Background
Describe the external fire exposure conditions and their potential impact on the protected equipment.

### Design Basis
- **Design code**: API-521 Section 4.4
- **Environmental factor (F)**: [0.075 - 1.0]
- **Insulation type**: [mineral wool, calcium silicate, etc.]
- **Insulation thickness**: [mm]
- **Fire scenario**: [pool fire, jet fire, flash fire]

### Fire Source Identification
Identify potential fire sources:
- Adjacent equipment containing flammable materials
- Piping containing hydrocarbons
- Storage tanks in vicinity
- Process vessels with combustible contents

### Wetted Surface Area Calculation

#### Equipment Exposed to Fire
List all equipment within the fire zone:

1. **[Equipment Tag]**:
   - Type: [vessel, tank, column, etc.]
   - Orientation: [horizontal/vertical]
   - Dimensions: [diameter × height/length]
   - Normal liquid level: [% or m]
   - Calculated wetted area: [m²]

**Total wetted surface area**: [m²]

### Heat Input Calculation

Using API-521 equation:

$$Q = 43,200 \times F \times A^{0.82}$$

Where:
- $Q$ = Heat absorption rate (W)
- $F$ = Environmental factor (considering insulation, drainage, firefighting)
- $A$ = Total wetted surface area (m²)

**Calculated heat input**: [kW]

### Relief Load Determination

$$W = \frac{Q}{\lambda}$$

Where:
- $W$ = Required relief rate (kg/h)
- $Q$ = Heat input (kW)
- $\lambda$ = Latent heat of vaporization (kJ/kg)

### Key Assumptions
- Fire duration as per API-521 guidelines
- Simultaneous exposure of all equipment in fire zone
- Credit taken for approved fireproofing: [Yes/No]
- Fire water/deluge systems available: [Yes/No]

### Code References
- API-521 Section 4.4: Fire Exposure
- NFPA 30: Flammable and Combustible Liquids Code
- Company HSE guidelines

### Conclusions
Summary of external fire analysis:
- Total wetted area: [m²]
- Heat absorption rate: [kW]
- Required relief capacity: [kg/h]
- Recommended protective measures
