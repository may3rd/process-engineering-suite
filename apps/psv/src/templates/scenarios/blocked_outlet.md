## Relief Scenario Analysis

### Background
Describe the process conditions and operating envelope that lead to this blocked outlet scenario.

### Design Basis
- **Design pressure**: [MAWP value]
- **Maximum allowable working pressure (MAWP)**: [value]
- **Set pressure**: [PSV set pressure]
- **Operating pressure**: [normal operating pressure]
- **Operating temperature**: [normal operating temperature]

### Scenario Description
The blocked outlet scenario occurs when:
- Downstream isolation valve is inadvertently closed
- Flow path becomes obstructed
- Continued operation of upstream equipment (pump, compressor, etc.)

### Relieving Load Calculation
Document the calculation methodology:

1. **Fluid properties at relieving conditions**:
   - Temperature: [°C]
   - Pressure: [barg]
   - Density: [kg/m³]
   - Viscosity: [cP]

2. **Equipment capacity**:
   - Pump/compressor rated capacity: [kg/h or m³/h]
   - Maximum discharge pressure: [barg]

3. **Relief rate determination**:
   - Relief rate = Equipment maximum capacity
   - Adjustments for temperature/pressure effects

### Key Assumptions
- List all critical assumptions made in the analysis
- Include safety factors applied
- Reference any industry standards or company guidelines

### Code References
- API-520 Part I: Sizing and Selection
- API-521: Pressure-Relieving and Depressuring Systems
- [Add other relevant codes]

### Conclusions
Summary of findings and recommendations:
- Required relief capacity: [kg/h]
- Recommended PSV size: [orifice designation]
- Additional safeguards considered
