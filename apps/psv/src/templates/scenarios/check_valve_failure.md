## Check Valve Failure Relief Scenario Analysis

### Background
Describe the check valve location, purpose, and the reverse flow scenario that could lead to overpressure.

### Design Basis
- **Design pressure**: [MAWP value]
- **Maximum allowable working pressure (MAWP)**: [value]
- **Set pressure**: [PSV set pressure]
- **Check valve location**: [describe in process flow]

### Scenario Description
Check valve failure (stuck open or leaking) can cause:
- Reverse flow from high-pressure system to low-pressure system
- Backflow during pump trip
- Unexpected liquid or gas ingress
- Pressure equalization between systems of different design pressures

### System Configuration

#### High-Pressure Side
- Normal operating pressure: [barg]
- Maximum source pressure: [barg]
- Fluid: [describe]
- Available flow rate for backflow: [kg/h]

#### Low-Pressure Side (Protected Equipment)
- Normal operating pressure: [barg]
- Design pressure (MAWP): [barg]
- Relief device set pressure: [barg]
- Volume: [m³]

### Reverse Flow Analysis

1. **Driving force**:
   - Pressure differential: [ΔP in bar]
   - Potential flow path: [describe]

2. **Flow rate calculation**:
   - Orifice/restriction size: [mm]
   - Calculated backflow rate: [kg/h]

3. **Pressurization rate**:
   - Time to reach set pressure: [minutes]

### Relief Load Determination

The relief rate must accommodate:
- Maximum reverse flow rate: [kg/h]
- Plus any additional process contributions

**Total required relief capacity**: [kg/h]

### Key Assumptions
- Complete check valve failure (stuck open)
- No operator intervention during initial phase
- High-pressure source at maximum pressure
- Process trips and interlocks function/fail

### Mitigating Factors
- Double check valve arrangement
- Pressure monitoring and alarms
- Automatic isolation on differential pressure
- Regular check valve testing

- API-521: Pressure-Relieving and Depressuring Systems
- API 594: Check Valves
- Company piping standards

### Conclusions
Summary of check valve failure scenario:
- Maximum reverse flow rate: [kg/h]
- Time to overpressure: [minutes]
- Required relief capacity: [kg/h]
- Recommended design modifications
