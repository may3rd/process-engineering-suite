# Network Editor Application

A powerful hydraulic network design and simulation tool, part of the Process Engineering Suite. Features drag-and-drop interface for modeling fluid networks with real-time hydraulic calculations.

## Overview

This application enables engineers to:

- **Visual Network Design**: Create fluid networks using an intuitive drag-and-drop interface
- **Hydraulic Calculations**: Perform incompressible flow calculations with pressure drop analysis
- **Component Management**: Configure pipes, pumps, valves, and other network components
- **Real-time Analysis**: Instant feedback on network performance and pressure distributions
- **Excel Integration**: Import/export network designs and calculation results

## Quick Start

```bash
# From monorepo root
npm install
npm run dev

# Or run Network Editor directly
cd apps/network-editor
npm run dev
```

The app runs on `http://localhost:3002` and is accessible via the dashboard at `http://localhost:3000/network-editor`.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 16 (App Router)
- **UI Library**: Material UI 7
- **Diagramming**: React Flow
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: MUI sx prop with glassmorphism theme

## Deployment

The Network Editor is deployed as part of the Process Engineering Suite using Docker.

### Docker Deployment

```bash
# From monorepo root
docker build -t process-engineering-suite .
docker run -p 3002:3002 \
  -e NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://your-api-server:8000 \
  process-engineering-suite
```

### Environment Variables

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`: Backend API endpoint for calculations (default: http://localhost:8000)

### Health Check

```bash
curl http://localhost:3002/api/health
```
